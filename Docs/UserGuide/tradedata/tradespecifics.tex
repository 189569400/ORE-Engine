\subsection{Trade Specific Data}

After the envelope node, trade-specific data for each trade type supported by
ORE is included. 
Each trade type has its own trade data container which is defined by an XML node 
containing a trade-specific
configuration of individual XML tags - called elements - and trade components. 
The trade components are defined by XML
sub-nodes that can be used within multiple trade data containers, i.e.  by multiple trade types.

\medskip

Details of  trade-specific data for all trade types follow below.
